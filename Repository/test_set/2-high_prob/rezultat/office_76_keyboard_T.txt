**Room Description:**
This is a modern open-plan office space with contemporary design features, including exposed black ceiling with decorative white circular lighting elements, workstation cubicles, and glass-walled meeting rooms.

**Search Results for White Keyboard:**
The white keyboard is **not visible** in this image. While I can see computer monitors at the workstations in the foreground, the keyboards at those workstations are not clearly visible due to the viewing angle and distance.

**Most Likely Search Locations:**
1. **At the workstation desks** - Keyboards would typically be positioned in front of the monitors on the desk surfaces
2. **In desk drawers** - Some office setups store keyboards in pull-out keyboard trays or drawers
3. **On the glass-enclosed office desks** - The background meeting rooms/offices may have workstations with keyboards

**Suggested Search Area:**
The workstation area in the foreground where monitors are visible: (5, 15), (45, 15), (45, 35), (5, 35)

**Probability of Success:** 75% - Keyboards are essential office equipment and would almost certainly be present at these computer workstations, just not visible from this viewing angle.
