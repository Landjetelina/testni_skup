**Object identification:**
- Right image: A black/dark colored dinner fork with four tines
- Left image: A modern kitchen with a wooden cabinet/island unit featuring a built-in sink and countertop

**Search results:**
The fork is **not visible** in the kitchen image. All visible surfaces (countertop, sink area) are clearly empty and unobstructed, so the fork is not present in any of the openly visible areas.

**Suggested search locations:**
Based on kitchen context, the fork is most likely stored in:

1. **Kitchen drawers** - specifically the drawers in the wooden cabinet unit, where cutlery is typically stored
2. **Inside the cabinet** - in the lower cabinet section of the wooden unit, possibly in a cutlery organizer
3. **Dish drying area** - potentially in a hidden drying rack or dish storage area not visible in this view

**Search area coordinates:**
Wooden cabinet unit (most likely location): (1.5, 1.0), (6.0, 1.0), (6.0, 4.5), (1.5, 4.5)

**Probability of success:** 85% - Forks are almost always stored in kitchen drawers or cabinets, and this appears to be the main storage unit in this kitchen.
