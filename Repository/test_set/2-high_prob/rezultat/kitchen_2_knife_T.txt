## Room Description
This is a commercial kitchen with professional-grade stainless steel equipment, including commercial cooking stations, overhead ventilation, upper cabinets, and a central prep island.

## Object Search: Steel, Sharp, Kitchen Knife

The kitchen knife is **not visible** in the image. While this is a professional kitchen where knives would be expected, I cannot see any knives clearly displayed on the visible surfaces.

## Search Recommendations

Based on the commercial kitchen context, the knife should be searched for in areas where kitchen tools are typically stored for food safety and organization purposes:

**Top 3 Most Likely Locations:**
1. **Inside the upper stainless steel cabinets** - Professional kitchens store knives in secure cabinet storage
2. **In drawers within the lower cabinet sections** - Standard location for organized knife storage
3. **In knife blocks or magnetic strips in non-visible cabinet areas** - Common professional storage methods

**Search Area Coordinates:** (0, 20), (100, 20), (100, 60), (0, 60)
This covers the cabinet and storage areas where knives would most likely be kept.

**Probability of Success:** 85% - Kitchen knives are essential tools in any commercial kitchen and are almost certainly present, just stored in proper locations for safety and hygiene compliance.

2. Search for the object: A steel, sharp, kitchen knife.

     - Table with prepped vegetables
     - Cutting boards
     - Bowls and utensils related to food preparation

     - (50, 70), (30, 35), (80, 30), (75, 90)

   - **Probability of object being found:** 50%
   - **Top 3 most likely places:**

     2. Underneath the sink (drawer or cabinet)
     3. On the floor (knife bins or cleaner pools occasionally happen in commercial kitchens)
