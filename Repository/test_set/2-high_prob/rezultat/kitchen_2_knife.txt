**Object Description:** A kitchen knife with a light wood-colored handle and a steel blade with "SILVERWARE" marking visible on it.

**Room Description:** A professional commercial kitchen with stainless steel counters, cabinets, appliances, and a white subway tile backsplash.

**Search Result:** The object is **not visible** in the kitchen image. While there are some utensils and kitchen tools visible on the counters and hanging areas, the specific knife with the wood handle shown in the right image cannot be clearly identified among them.

**Suggested Search Areas:**

Since this is a commercial kitchen and knives are essential tools that need to be stored safely and accessibly, I suggest searching in:

**Top 3 Most Likely Locations:**
1. **Inside the stainless steel drawers** - Professional kitchens typically store knives in designated knife drawers with protective slots
2. **Behind/inside the stainless steel cabinets** - Upper or lower cabinets may contain knife storage blocks or magnetic strips
3. **In knife storage areas on the prep stations** - There may be knife blocks or magnetic holders on the work surfaces that aren't clearly visible from this angle

**Search Area Coordinates:** (6.0, 3.0), (9.0, 3.0), (9.0, 6.0), (6.0, 6.0) - focusing on the main prep counter and storage areas on the right side of the kitchen.

**Probability of Success:** 75% - Knives are essential tools in any kitchen and must be stored somewhere within the workspace for food safety and accessibility reasons.

### Object on the right image
- The object is a **silver kitchen knife** with a wooden handle and a green accent near the blade.

### Room on the left image
- The room is a **professional kitchen**, evident from the large counters, gas stoves, and culinary equipment commonly found in such spaces.

### Searching for the object in the room

Since the knife is a sharp, professional-grade utensil typically found in a professional kitchen, it's highly likely to be positioned somewhere near the cooking area, especially on or in a kitchen tool rack, cutting board, or by the stove.

1. **Rectangular search area (if object is not found)**:
   - Top-left corner: (1.5, 1.5)
   - Top-right corner: (8.5, 1.5)
   - Bottom-left corner: (1.5, 4.5)
   - Bottom-right corner: (8.5, 4.5)

### Suggested locations to search for the knife:
1. Near the gas stoves: There is a high chance this kitchen is used for food preparation.
2. In a knife rack underulate the counter directly below or to the side of the countertop near the area of stoves.
3. On the cutting boards, which are usually within easy reach if the chef is actively preparing food.

### Probability of success
- 90% (due to the compelling presence of cooking and culinary equipment highly related to the object's nature).

**Additional notes:** If not found on or near the stove or cutting board, (80-90%), a search in the storage area under or near the countertop could be fruitful, commonly storing specialized tools.
