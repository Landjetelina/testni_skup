**Object Description:** A black TV remote control with blue and colored buttons (appears to be a streaming device remote, possibly Roku or similar).

**Room Description:** A bohemian-style living room with a tan leather sofa covered in decorative pillows, a wooden coffee table with storage, dark cabinets/entertainment center, plants, and rustic decor elements including a bull skull on the wall.

**Search Result:** The remote is **not visible** in the living room image.

**Search Recommendation:** 
The remote is likely hidden from view in areas where remotes are commonly placed. I suggest searching:

**Top 3 Most Likely Locations:**
1. **Between/under the sofa cushions** - remotes often slip into cushions during use
2. **In the wooden coffee table storage compartments** - the coffee table appears to have built-in storage drawers/shelves
3. **On or behind items on the entertainment center/dark cabinets** - remotes are often placed near TV equipment

**Search Area Coordinates:** Focus on the sofa and coffee table area: (15%, 15%), (70%, 15%), (70%, 65%), (15%, 65%)

**Probability of Success:** 75% - These are the most common locations for misplaced remotes in a living room setting.
