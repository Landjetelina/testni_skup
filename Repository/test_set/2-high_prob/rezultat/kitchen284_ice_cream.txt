1. The object in the right image is "a container of cookie dough."
2. The room in the left image is "a kitchen."

3. The container of cookie dough is not visible in the left image.

Searching the left image for the object, I suggest the following locations based on the context and room configuration:

- **Kitchen countertop**: A container like this is often kept on a countertop in a kitchen. The probability of finding it here is **70%**.
- **Back of the refrigerator**: Remains a plausible location if the container was recently placed there or if small containers like this are stored there.
- **On the shelf**: The upper shelf of the yellow cabinet may be a spot, but it's less likely as itâ€™s not a common spot for cookie dough.

Use the following coordinates for the search area (in decimal format):
- (15, 85), (20, 90), (5, 60), (10, 70)
