**Room Description:**
This is a modern kitchen with white upper cabinets, dark lower cabinets, white countertops, stainless steel appliances, and a kitchen island with a wood butcher block top.

**Object Search Result:**
The white dining plate is **not visible** in this kitchen image.

**Where to search for it:**
Based on the kitchen context, white dining plates would typically be stored in cabinets rather than left out on counters. I suggest searching in the upper white cabinets, as these are commonly used for dishware storage in kitchens.

**Top 3 most likely search locations:**
1. Upper white cabinets (likely containing dishware)
2. Lower dark cabinets near the sink area (dish storage)
3. Drawers in the kitchen island (additional storage)

**Search area coordinates:** (5, 70), (95, 70), (95, 95), (5, 95)

**Probability of finding the white dining plate in at least one of these locations: 85%**
