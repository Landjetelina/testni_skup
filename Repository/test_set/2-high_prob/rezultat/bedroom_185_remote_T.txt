## Object Search: Black TV Remote

The black TV remote is **not visible** in the image.

Given the room context, I suggest searching in areas that are not clearly visible or accessible in the current view. The remote is likely stored in:

1. **Inside the built-in shelving unit** above the TV (items on shelves are not clearly distinguishable)
2. **In a drawer of the bedside furniture** (partially visible but contents not seen)
3. **On or around the gray bench seating area** (some areas may be obscured from this angle)

**Search area coordinates for the shelving unit above TV:** (15, 70), (85, 70), (85, 85), (15, 85)

## Top 3 Most Likely Search Locations:
1. **Built-in shelving above the TV** - remotes are commonly stored near entertainment centers
2. **Bedside table drawers** - convenient storage for frequently used items
3. **On or between cushions of the gray bench** - remotes often get misplaced on seating furniture

**Probability of finding the remote in at least one of these locations: 75%**
