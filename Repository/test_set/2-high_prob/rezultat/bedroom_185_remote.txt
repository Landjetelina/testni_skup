**Object identification:**
Right image: A white/silver wireless computer keyboard with standard QWERTY layout.

**Room identification:**
Left image: A modern open-plan office space with contemporary design, featuring workstations with blue chairs, white desks, decorative ceiling elements, and large windows.

**Search results:**
The keyboard is **not visible** in the office space. While I can see workstations with blue chairs and white desks, no keyboards are clearly visible on any of the desk surfaces from this viewing angle.

**Most likely search locations:**
1. **On desk surfaces at workstations** - keyboards would typically be placed directly in front of computer monitors
2. **In desk drawers** - keyboards are often stored in pull-out keyboard trays or drawers
3. **On side tables or secondary surfaces** - keyboards might be temporarily placed on nearby surfaces

**Suggested search area coordinates:**
The main workstation area where keyboards would most likely be located:
(15, 15), (85, 15), (85, 45), (15, 45)

**Probability of success:** 85% - Keyboards are essential office equipment and would very likely be present at the workstations, just not visible from this particular viewing angle or distance.

The keyboard is **not visible in the image**. Based on the room context, it's likely that the keyboard is either:
1. In a user's personal workstation.
2. Storage area (drawer, cabinet).
3. On another desk or table.

**Coordinates of a possible search area (desk area):**
(10, 65) to (55, 75)

**Top 3 most likely places to search in the room:**
