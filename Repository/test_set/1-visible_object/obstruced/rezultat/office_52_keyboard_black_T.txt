**Room Description:**
This is a modern home office or study room with white walls, featuring a polka dot accent wall, a world map artwork, and musical equipment including guitars and an amplifier.

**Search Results:**
The black mechanical keyboard is **not visible** in this image.

I can see a laptop on the white desk/table on the left side, but no separate mechanical keyboard is visible on any of the clearly visible surfaces (desk, white storage unit, floor).

**Search Area Recommendation:**
The keyboard is most likely near the computer setup area where the laptop is located, possibly:

**Top 3 Most Likely Locations:**
1. **In a desk drawer** - The white desk may have drawers that aren't visible from this angle
2. **Behind or under the laptop** - Could be stored beneath the current laptop setup
3. **In one of the white storage bins** - The cube storage unit has multiple fabric bins that could contain the keyboard

**Search Area Coordinates:** (0, 0), (35, 0), (35, 50), (0, 50)

**Probability of Success:** 75%

The keyboard would realistically be stored near the computer workstation area for easy access when needed.
