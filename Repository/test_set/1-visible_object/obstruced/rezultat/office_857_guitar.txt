- The object in the right image is a guitar.
- The room in the left image is a cluttered home office.

We do not see the guitar in the left image. Based on the room context, the guitar is likely to be in one of the following locations:
1. On a shelf or in a closet (70% probability)
2. In a corner where it can be stored (20% probability)
3. On a wall mount (10% probability)
