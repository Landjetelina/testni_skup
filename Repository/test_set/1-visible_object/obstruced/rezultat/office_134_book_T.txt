1. The room appears to be a home office with a desk, a chair, and a laptop on the desk. There are decorative items and framed pictures on the wall.

2. The object, a blue textbook, is located on the bottom shelf of the desk on the left side. Its approximate position is (15, 15) in the image.

Since the blue textbook is visible, no further search is necessary.

**Room Description:**
This is a home office or study room with brown/tan walls, featuring a white modern desk with cross-leg design, a beige upholstered chair, and a gallery wall with framed artwork and motivational prints.

**Search Results for Blue Textbook:**
The blue textbook is **not visible** in this image.

I can see some books stored under the desk on a lower shelf/ledge, but I cannot definitively identify a blue textbook among them due to lighting and angle limitations.

**Top 3 Most Likely Search Locations:**
1. **Under the desk on the lower shelf** - There are several books visible here that need closer inspection
2. **Inside the desk drawer** - The desk appears to have a drawer that could contain textbooks
3. **On the floor behind/beside the chair** - Areas not fully visible in the current view

**Search Area Coordinates:** (10, 5), (90, 5), (90, 35), (10, 35)

**Probability of Success:** 75% - The desk area and immediate surroundings are very likely places for textbooks in a study/office environment.
