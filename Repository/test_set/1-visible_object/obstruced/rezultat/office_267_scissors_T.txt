**Room Description:**
This is a home office or study room with an L-shaped desk setup, featuring dual monitors, extensive storage with organized boxes on shelves, and various office supplies.

**Search Results:**
I can see what appears to be blue scissors in the pencil/pen holder container on the desk shelf. The scissors are located at approximately **(75%, 65%)**.

However, upon closer examination of the image quality and lighting, I cannot definitively confirm these are blue scissors rather than other blue office supplies or tools in the container.

**If not found, top 3 most likely search locations:**

1. **Desk drawers** - The white drawer unit under the right side of the desk likely contains office supplies including scissors
   Search area: (65, 15), (85, 15), (85, 35), (65, 35)

2. **Storage boxes on shelves** - The numerous labeled storage boxes likely contain organized office supplies
   Search area: (50, 55), (95, 55), (95, 85), (50, 85)

3. **Wooden shelf unit** - The left shelving unit appears to store various supplies and materials
   Search area: (5, 25), (25, 25), (25, 75), (5, 75)

**Probability of finding blue scissors in at least one of these locations: 80%**

The object is realistic for this context as scissors are common office supplies typically found in home offices and study rooms.
