**Object Description:** A white/silver wireless computer keyboard with white keys and gray text labels.

**Room Description:** A home office or study room with a cluttered desk containing dual monitors, books, office supplies, and a cat. There's a bicycle wheel visible in the background.

**Search Result:** The object is **not visible** in the left image. I can see there is already a different keyboard (appears to be black/dark colored) on the desk near the monitors, but the white wireless keyboard from the right image is not present.

**Suggested Search Locations:**
Since this is a home office with limited visible storage and the desk is quite cluttered, the wireless keyboard could be:

1. **In a desk drawer** - Most likely location for storing an extra keyboard
2. **On a shelf or storage area** - Behind books or other items that are blocking the view
3. **In the area behind/under the desk** - Could have been stored away temporarily

**Search Area Coordinates:** 
Focusing on the desk area where keyboards would typically be stored:
(15, 10), (85, 10), (85, 55), (15, 55)

**Probability of Success:** 75% - Given this is a tech workspace, it's quite likely the wireless keyboard is stored nearby in a drawer or shelf area.

### Left Image Description:
The left image shows a room that appears to be a home office or study. It contains a desk with a cluttered surface, stacks of books and papers, a computer setup with two monitors, and various items such as a cat, a headset, a computer keyboard, a water bottle, and other miscellaneous objects. Shelving in the background holds more books and possibly decorative items. A bicycle wheel is visible in the upper right corner of the room.

### Right Image Description:
The right image is a clear photograph of a white Apple wireless keyboard.

### Search Results:
- **Object Identified in the Right Image:** A white Apple wireless keyboard.
- **Room in the Left Image:** Home office or study.
- **Search for the Object:**
  - The keyboard is visible in the photograph on the right and is being described as a separate object, so it's not present in the left image. It appears in the top row, second from the left, in the keyboard.

Since the object (Apple wireless keyboard) is not visible in the left image, we can attempt to locate it if it were to be within the room:
- **Suggested Search Area:** Keyboard remotes (often located on the desk) or next to a TV remote.
- **Most Likely Place to Find the Object:**
  1. Desk suraface (if it is on a desk or users frequently use the keyboard there).
  2. Near the computer monitor (if used while looking at the screen).
  3. Next to the TV remote(s) (if near or within reach of the computer area).

- **Probability of Finding the Object:**
  Approx. 70% chance that the object is in a position where it is commonly found (e.g., on a desk or near the main computer entry point).

### Search Area:
The search area coordinates for the left image where the keyboard might hypothetically be:
- X1: 20%
- Y1: 70%
- X2: 30%
- Y2: 80%

These coordinates specify the search area in the top-right portion of the desk in the left image where the keyboard is commonly kept for easy access.
