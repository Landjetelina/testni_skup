**Object Description:**
The right image shows a pair of eyeglasses with thin metal frames and round/oval lenses.

**Room Description:**
The left image shows a modern office or lounge area with floor-to-ceiling windows, featuring a red sofa, two blue armchairs, a white round coffee table, and built-in shelving along the back wall.

**Search Results:**
The eyeglasses are **not visible** in the image. All furniture surfaces and shelving areas that are clearly visible do not show the glasses.

**Suggested Search Locations:**
Based on the room context, I suggest searching in areas that are not fully visible or accessible:

**Top 3 Most Likely Places:**
1. **Inside the built-in shelving drawers/cabinets** - The teal credenza appears to have storage compartments
2. **On the shelving units behind decorative items** - Objects could be obscured by plants, books, or decorative pieces
3. **Under cushions of the seating furniture** - Glasses commonly slip between or under sofa/chair cushions

**Search Area Coordinates:**
Focus on the built-in shelving wall unit: (40, 25), (75, 25), (75, 65), (40, 65)

**Probability of Success:** 70% - Eyeglasses are commonly misplaced in office/lounge environments, particularly in storage areas or furniture where people sit and work.
