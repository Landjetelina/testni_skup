**Object Description:** A black mechanical keyboard with red accent keys (appears to be ESC and another key).

**Room Description:** A modern home office/study room with white walls, polka dot wallpaper accent wall, a white desk with drawers, black loveseat, decorative pillows, artwork gallery wall, and various office supplies.

**Search Results:** The black keyboard is **not visible** in the room.

**Suggested Search Location:** The keyboard would most likely be stored in or near the desk area since this is a home office setup. I recommend searching the desk drawers or the area around/under the desk where computer peripherals are typically stored.

**Search Area Coordinates:** (5, 15), (45, 15), (45, 55), (5, 55)

**Top 3 Most Likely Places to Search:**
1. Inside the white desk drawers
2. On a keyboard tray under the desk (not visible from this angle)
3. In a storage area behind or beside the desk setup

**Probability of Success:** 75% - Very likely to find the keyboard in one of these desk-related storage locations, as this is clearly a computer workspace and keyboards are essential peripherals typically stored nearby.
