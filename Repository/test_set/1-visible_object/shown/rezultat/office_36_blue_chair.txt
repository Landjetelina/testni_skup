1. **Object in the right image:** A blue armchair.

   **Room in the left image:** A modern living room featuring large windows, a red sofa, two blue armchairs, a patterned rug, a wooden shelving unit, and a couple of round coffee tables.

2. **Search for the object:**

   - **Object visibility:** The blue armchair in the right image is **not visible** among the furnishings in the left image. The armchairs in the living room have a different design.
   
   - **Suggested search area:** Since the object is not visible, search near similar seating areas or rooms adjacent to the living room.
   
   - **Rectangular search area coordinates:** Given that itâ€™s not visible, a realistic search could focus on areas typically hosting additional chairs, such as corners of the living room or near other seating arrangements:
     - (60, 0), (100, 0), (100, 30), (60, 30)

3. **Top 3 most likely places to search in the room:**

   - Near other seating areas in the living room.
   - In adjacent rooms like a study or secondary living room.
   - Stored in a larger hallway or closet area.
   
   **Probability of success:** 70% (depending on the house layout and storage)

**Object Description:** A light blue/grayish-blue upholstered armchair with wooden legs and modern design.

**Room Description:** A modern living room with contemporary design featuring a red/pink sofa, blue armchairs, white round coffee table, built-in shelving unit, large windows with ocean view, and industrial-style ceiling.

**Search Result:** I can see two blue armchairs in the living room, but they appear to be a darker blue color compared to the lighter blue/grayish-blue chair shown in the right image. The chair from the right image is **not visible** in this room.

**Suggested Search Locations:**
Since this appears to be a modern apartment/home, the light blue chair could be located in:

1. **Adjacent rooms** (bedroom, dining area, or home office) - probability of finding it in one of these areas
2. **Behind the built-in shelving unit** - there appears to be space that's not fully visible
3. **Near the entrance area** by the wooden door - partially obscured area

**Search Area Coordinates:** The area near the entrance/door where the chair might be partially hidden:
Rectangle corners: (75, 0), (95, 0), (95, 60), (75, 60)

**Overall Probability:** 70% chance the chair will be found in one of the suggested locations within this home.
