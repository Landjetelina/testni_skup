### Right Image Description:

### Search:
I have searched the left image for a yellow acoustic guitar similar to the one in the right image.
- **Result:** Not found.

Given the similarity of the guitars, searching near the position where the guitar on the left is leaning against the sofa might be a good strategy. Additionally, checking the floor and any nearby areas to the sofa due to the guitar's proximity in the scene.
