**Room Description:**
This is a modern home office/workspace that doubles as a casual seating area. The room features a white desk with a leopard print chair, a black loveseat with decorative pillows, and a distinctive black polka-dotted accent wall with framed artwork.

**Search Results:**
I found a black mechanical keyboard on the white desk. It is positioned to the left side of the desk workspace, appearing to be placed on or near the desk surface.

**Location:** The black mechanical keyboard is located at approximately **(15%, 25%)** in the image.

The keyboard is clearly visible on the desk area and appears to be a standard black mechanical keyboard, which is perfectly realistic and appropriate for this home office setting.
