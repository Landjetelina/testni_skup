     - Inside one of the open cabinets.
     - Near the stove and cooking ingredients.

**Room Description:**
This is a commercial kitchen with professional-grade stainless steel equipment, including commercial ovens, a large exhaust hood, stainless steel countertops, and white subway tile backsplash.

**Search Results:**
The yellow rubber duck is **not visible** in this commercial kitchen.

A yellow rubber duck would be highly unrealistic and inappropriate in this professional commercial kitchen environment, as it would violate health and safety regulations for food preparation areas.

**Top 3 Most Likely Search Locations:**
1. Storage areas or employee break rooms (not visible in this kitchen space)
2. Cleaning supply storage areas where it might have been brought in accidentally
3. Employee personal belongings area or locker room

**Probability of finding the object in at least one of these locations:** 15%

**Suggested Search Area:**
Since this is an inappropriate setting for a rubber duck, I suggest searching areas adjacent to this kitchen that might house personal items or non-food storage.

**Search Rectangle Coordinates:** (0, 0), (100, 0), (100, 100), (0, 100)
[This encompasses the entire visible area, though finding a rubber duck here would be highly unlikely due to the professional kitchen context]
