**Room Description:**
This is a modern kitchen with dark lower cabinets, white upper cabinets, white countertops, stainless steel appliances, and a kitchen island with a butcher block top.

**Search Results:**
The yellow rubber duck is **not visible** in this kitchen image.

**Reasoning:**
A yellow rubber duck in a kitchen is somewhat unusual but not unrealistic - it could be a decorative item, a child's toy that was brought in, or part of kitchen accessories. However, I cannot find it among the clearly visible items on the countertops, island, or open surfaces.

**Top 3 Most Likely Search Locations:**
1. **Inside kitchen drawers** - particularly in the island or lower cabinets where small items are typically stored
2. **Kitchen sink area** - rubber ducks are bath toys and might be near water sources, potentially in or around the sink
3. **Inside upper cabinets** - behind the glass-front cabinet doors where it might be stored with other items

**Search Area Coordinates:**
Kitchen sink and surrounding counter area: (30, 35), (70, 35), (70, 65), (30, 65)

**Probability of Success:** 25% - While these are logical places to search, a rubber duck is not a typical kitchen item, making it less likely to be found even in the most probable locations.

**Search Results:**

The yellow rubber duck is not visible in the provided image. It is highly unlikely that the yellow rubber duck would be located in a kitchen. A probable location for such an object would be a child's play area, bathroom, or perhaps a bathroom-related section of the home like a wet bar or mudroom.

**Top 3 most likely places to search:**
1. Bathroom (25%, given the yellow rubber duck is typically found in this area) - Look under sinks, in cabinets, or on shelves.
2. Child's play area (25%, given children's toys are often kept in these areas) - Look in toy chests, playrooms, or closets.
3. Mudroom or foyer (20%, as outdoor clothing and rain items might be stored here) - Look under hooks, in utility cabinets, or on shelves near the front door.

No search area specified, as the yellow rubber duck has not been identified in the image.
