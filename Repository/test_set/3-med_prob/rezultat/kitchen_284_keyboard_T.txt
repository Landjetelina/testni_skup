**Room Description:**
This is a modern kitchen with an industrial-style design featuring exposed ceiling beams, white brick walls, dark countertops, white lower cabinets, and a distinctive yellow tall storage cabinet.

**Search Results for White Keyboard:**
The white keyboard is **not visible** in this kitchen image.

**Reasoning and Suggested Search Areas:**
A white keyboard would be unusual but not unrealistic in a modern kitchen, as many people use laptops or tablets for recipes, shopping lists, or entertainment while cooking. However, since no keyboard is visible on the countertops, dining areas, or open shelving, it would likely be stored away.

**Top 3 Most Likely Search Locations:**
1. **Inside the yellow storage cabinet drawers/compartments** - Modern storage often includes tech organization spaces
2. **Inside the white lower kitchen cabinets** - Common storage for non-cooking items
3. **In the blue shelving unit on the left wall** - Appears to have storage compartments that could house electronics

**Probability of Success:** 60%
