**Object description:** A white plate or shallow bowl with a simple, clean design.

**Room description:** A modern open-plan office space with contemporary design, featuring workstations, office chairs, decorative ceiling elements, and large windows.

**Search result:** The white plate is **not visible** in the office space.

**Analysis:** A white plate in an office environment is contextually unusual but not impossible - it could be present if employees eat meals at their desks or in a break area within this open office space.

**Suggested search locations:**

Since plates are typically found where people eat, I would suggest searching:

1. **Desktop surfaces** - employees might have plates on their desks after eating
2. **Any kitchen/break area** - though not clearly visible in this view, there may be a kitchenette area
3. **Storage cabinets or drawers** - office furniture that could contain personal items or supplies

**Search area coordinates:** The central workstation area where desks and potential storage would be located:
(15, 10), (85, 10), (85, 50), (15, 50)

**Top 3 most likely locations to search:**
1. Desk surfaces or drawers in the workstation area
2. Any break room or kitchen area (if present but not visible)
3. Storage cabinets near the workstations

**Probability of finding the object:** 25% - while contextually unusual for an office, there's a modest chance it could be present for dining purposes.

The object in the right image is a white saucer. The room in the left image is an open-plan office with offices, desks, and chairs.

I cannot find the white saucer in the office image. Suggesting where to search for it:
- Desks and shelves could be myths, but combs/bras exaggeratedly clserved to be in there.
- Objects that could pass as such are often located on shelves or desks.
- Suggested search target areas in the office (0%,0%) the bottom-left corner to (100%,100%) the top-right corner of the left picture are: (0, 0), (100, 0), (50, 50), (0, 50%).
