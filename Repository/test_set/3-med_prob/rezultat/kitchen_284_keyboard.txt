**Object Description:** A black mechanical keyboard with dark gray/black keys and orange accent keys on the corners.

**Room Description:** A modern kitchen with white cabinets, dark blue backsplash, yellow open shelving unit, exposed ceiling beams, and a window with plants on the sill.

**Search Result:** The keyboard is **not visible** in this kitchen.

This object is unrealistic in this kitchen context, as keyboards are computer peripherals that don't belong in cooking spaces. However, if searching for it:

**Top 3 Most Likely Search Locations:**
1. **Yellow shelving unit compartments** - The open shelves might contain miscellaneous items
2. **Kitchen drawers** - Items are often stored in drawers out of sight
3. **Counter areas behind/beside appliances** - Areas not clearly visible in the current view

**Search Area Coordinates:** Yellow shelving unit area: (70, 25), (85, 25), (85, 75), (70, 75)

**Probability of Success:** 15% - Very low likelihood due to the inappropriate context of a keyboard in a kitchen setting.
