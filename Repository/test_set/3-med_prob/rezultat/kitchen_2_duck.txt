**Object Description:** A yellow rubber duck with an orange beak - a classic bath toy.

**Room Description:** A commercial/professional kitchen with stainless steel appliances, cabinets, countertops, and a central prep island. Features include a range hood, stovetop, and various cooking equipment.

**Search Result:** The rubber duck is **not visible** in this commercial kitchen.

**Reasoning:** A rubber duck in a commercial kitchen would be highly unrealistic and inappropriate, as this appears to be a professional food preparation environment where toys would violate health and safety regulations. Rubber ducks belong in bathrooms/bathtubs, not commercial kitchens.

**However, if hypothetically searching for this object in this space, the most likely locations would be:**

1. **Inside cabinet drawers or storage areas** - where miscellaneous items might be temporarily stored
2. **Behind equipment on counters** - where small objects could be accidentally placed
3. **In the sink area** - the only location with water access similar to its normal environment

**Search area coordinates for general storage/hidden areas:**
(15, 25), (85, 25), (85, 75), (15, 75)

**Probability of finding the rubber duck in at least one of these locations: 5%** - extremely low due to the inappropriate context of a toy in a commercial kitchen environment.
