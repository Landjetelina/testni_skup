## Room Description
This is a modern kitchen with white cabinets, stainless steel appliances, a mosaic tile backsplash, and hardwood flooring. The kitchen features a window above the sink area and appears to be well-lit and clean.

## Object Search: Stuffed Monkey Toy
The stuffed monkey toy is **not visible** in this kitchen image.

## Suggested Search Areas
Based on the kitchen context, I suggest searching in areas that are not clearly visible but could contain stored items:

**Top 3 most likely places to search:**
1. **Inside the cabinets/drawers** - Kitchen cabinets and drawers often contain miscellaneous household items including children's toys
2. **Behind the peninsula/island area** - There may be storage or floor space not visible from this angle
3. **In pantry or storage areas** - If there are pantry spaces or storage rooms adjacent to this kitchen

**Rectangular search area coordinates for cabinet storage:**
(15, 40), (85, 40), (85, 85), (15, 85)

**Probability of finding the stuffed monkey toy in at least one of these locations: 25%**

Note: A stuffed monkey toy in a kitchen is somewhat unusual, as toys are typically stored in bedrooms, playrooms, or living areas rather than cooking spaces.
