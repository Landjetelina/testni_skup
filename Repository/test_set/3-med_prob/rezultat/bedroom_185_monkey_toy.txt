Since this is a plush toy that would typically be found in sleeping areas or personal spaces, I suggest searching:

1. **On or under the bed** - plush toys are commonly kept on beds for comfort or may fall between the mattress and wall
2. **Storage areas/closet** - toys are often stored in closets or drawers when not in use  
3. **Behind/under the sofa** - the gray sofa could conceal the toy if it fell behind or underneath

**Search area coordinates:** The bed area where the toy is most likely to be found:

**Probability of success:** 75% - The sock monkey is likely to be found in at least one of these locations, particularly on or around the bed area, as plush toys are commonly kept in bedrooms for comfort.
