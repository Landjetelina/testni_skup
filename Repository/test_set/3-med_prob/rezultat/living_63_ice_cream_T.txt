## Room Description
This is a modern living room with a minimalist Scandinavian design. It features a large gray sectional sofa, white coffee table, white entertainment center with wall-mounted TV, white paneled walls, dark wood flooring, and contemporary lighting.

## Object Search: Box of Ice Cream

The box of ice cream is **not visible** in this living room image.

This is an unrealistic object to find in a living room context, as ice cream requires frozen storage and would typically be kept in a kitchen freezer, not in a living space where it would melt.

## Most Likely Search Locations
Since ice cream must be kept frozen, the top 3 most likely places to search would be:

1. **Kitchen freezer** (main freezer compartment)
2. **Kitchen freezer** (freezer drawer if bottom-freezer refrigerator)  
3. **Separate chest freezer** (if present in home)

**Probability of finding the ice cream in at least one of these locations: 85%**

**Search area coordinates** (representing the general area where a kitchen might be located, likely adjacent to this living room):
(0, 0), (40, 0), (40, 100), (0, 100)
