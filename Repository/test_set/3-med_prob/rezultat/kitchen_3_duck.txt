**Object identification:**
- Right image: A yellow rubber duck with an orange/red beak
- Left image: A modern kitchen with white upper cabinets, dark lower cabinets, white countertops, and stainless steel appliances

**Search results:**
The rubber duck is **not visible** in the kitchen image.

**Object context assessment:**
A rubber duck in a kitchen is somewhat unusual but not unrealistic - it could be present as a decorative item, novelty kitchen timer, or cleaning accessory.

**Suggested search locations:**
The rubber duck is likely hidden from view. Based on the kitchen layout and typical placement patterns, I suggest searching:

**Top 3 most likely places:**
1. **Kitchen sink area** - rubber ducks are commonly associated with water and could be near the sink for cleaning or as decoration
2. **Inside drawers** - particularly utility drawers that might contain miscellaneous items
3. **On the window sill** - above the sink area where small decorative items are often placed

**Search area coordinates:**
Kitchen sink and surrounding counter area: (10, 20), (45, 20), (45, 55), (10, 55)

**Probability of success:** 65% - The duck could reasonably be in one of these locations, though its presence in a kitchen is not guaranteed.
