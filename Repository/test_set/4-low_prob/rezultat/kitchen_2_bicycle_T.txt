**Room Description:**
This is a commercial kitchen with stainless steel appliances, cabinets, and work surfaces. It features professional-grade equipment including a large range hood, cooking stations, prep tables, and appears to be designed for restaurant or institutional food service.

**Object Search - Red Bicycle:**
The red bicycle is **not visible** in this commercial kitchen space.

**Reasoning:**
A red bicycle would be highly unrealistic and inappropriate in a commercial kitchen environment due to health code violations, safety hazards, and practical constraints. Commercial kitchens must maintain strict hygiene standards and clear pathways for food preparation and service.

**Most Likely Search Locations in Context:**
Given that a bicycle would not belong in this kitchen, if one were somehow present, the most likely locations would be:

1. **Behind the central prep table** - where it might be temporarily stored out of the main work flow
2. **In the corner area near the dishwasher unit** (right side) - less frequently accessed during peak operations  
3. **Under or behind the prep counter on the left** - where it could be tucked away from the main cooking area

**Search Area Coordinates:**
Central prep table area and surrounding spaces: (20, 15), (80, 15), (80, 55), (20, 55)

**Probability of Success:** 5% - A bicycle would be extremely unlikely to be found in this professional kitchen environment due to health and safety regulations.

I searched the room for the **red bicycle** but did not find it. Given the context, a red bicycle is unlikely to be found in a commercial kitchen. Based on realistic reasoning, here are the top 3 most likely places to locate the red bicycle:

1. **Near parking/garage:** Likely > **50%**
2. **In пров An apartment or personal residence where someone owns a red bicycle. Likely > **30%.**
3. **On the wall/cabinet shelf:** Likely around **10%**
