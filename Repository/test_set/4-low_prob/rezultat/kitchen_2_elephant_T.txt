1. **Room Description:**
   - Commercial kitchen with stainless steel appliances and counters, white tiled walls, and a large ventilation hood.

2. **Object Search:**
   - The large, live, gray African elephant is **not visible** in the image. This is an unrealistic object to find in a commercial kitchen due to its size and the nature of the space.

3. **Suggested Search Areas:**
   - Given the impracticality of an elephant being in this setting, it would not logically fit or be hidden here. However, if searching for smaller objects, consider these areas:
     1. Inside large storage units or walk-in coolers, if present.
     2. Near open space towards the center not covered by countertops.
     3. Any entryways outside the visible area.

4. **Coordinates of Search Area:**
   - Not applicable for this scenario as the elephant is unlikely to be missed if present.

5. **Probability of Finding the Object in Suggested Areas:**
   - **0%** due to the impracticality of an elephant fitting in or entering this setting without being immediately visible.

## Room Description:
This is a commercial kitchen featuring stainless steel appliances, equipment, and work surfaces. It has white subway tile backsplash, dark tile flooring, a large ventilation hood, and professional cooking equipment including stovetops and preparation areas.

## Object Search - Large, Live, Gray, African Elephant:

**Object is NOT visible** in the image.

This is an unrealistic search request - a large, live, gray African elephant cannot physically fit in any indoor kitchen space, especially a commercial kitchen of this size. Adult African elephants are massive animals (weighing 4,000-14,000 pounds and standing 8-13 feet tall) that require outdoor habitats and cannot survive in enclosed commercial spaces designed for food preparation.

## Most Likely Search Areas (hypothetically):
Given the impossibility of the object fitting in this space, but following the format requested:

1. **Behind the central work island** - largest open floor area
2. **In the corner areas** - where maximum space might be available  
3. **Near the entrance/exit areas** - though not visible in this view

**Search area coordinates:** (10, 5), (90, 5), (90, 35), (10, 35)

**Probability of finding the object:** 0% - This object cannot realistically exist in this environment.

-----------------------------------------
The input describes a large, live, gray, African elephant in an enclosed space, likely a room (a kitchen, specifically a commercial kitchen). However, in the provided image, there is no elephant present. 

### Step 1: Describe the room
The room appears to be **a commercial kitchen, likely used for food preparation and cooking**. The kitchen features stainless steel counters, ventilation hoods, a cooker, and standard commercial kitchen appliances.

### Step 2: Search for the African elephant
The **African elephant** is not visibly in the image. Possible locations within the kitchen where the elephant **should realistically be (magic excepted)**, given context clues but clearly given advice against unrealistic expectations:

- **On the counter or stove area (0%, 40% - 30%, 70%)**.
  - **Search possibility percentage: 20%**
- **Within cabinets (10%, 20% - 80%, 60%)**.
  - **Search possibility percentage: 15%**
- **Under floors or storage rooms (25%, 0% - 75%, 50%)**.
  - **Search possibility percentage: 10%**

### Step 3: Provide the search location and probability percentages
The top 3 most likely places to search include:
- **Counter area**: (0%, 40% - 30%, 70%), **20% success chance of finding a hidden elephant.**
- **Cabinets under rise-down areas country home, saving Lá»‹ "[0% - 80%, 50%]** (Search percentage: **15%**).
- **Hiding no doors into Modal inside the house first**, if any're (0%, 60% - 30%, 50%), Possible cork percentage **10%** suggestion.
