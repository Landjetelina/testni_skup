Looking at the two images:

**Object identification:** The right image shows a light blue upholstered armchair with wooden legs in a modern style.

**Room identification:** The left image shows a commercial or professional kitchen with stainless steel appliances, cabinets, countertops, and a large exhaust hood.

**Search result:** The blue armchair is **not visible** in the kitchen image. This is also contextually unrealistic - furniture like armchairs would not typically be found in a commercial kitchen environment due to hygiene regulations, space constraints, and safety requirements.

**Suggestion:** Since this is a commercial kitchen, the armchair would not logically belong in this space. If searching within this room were necessary, the most concealed areas would be:

**Top 3 most likely search locations:**
1. Behind the kitchen island (not fully visible from this angle)
2. In the corner area to the left of the visible workspace
3. Behind the stainless steel equipment along the back wall

**Search area coordinates:** The most obstructed area behind the central island:
(35, 15), (65, 15), (65, 40), (35, 40)

**Probability of finding the armchair in this kitchen:** 5% (extremely unlikely due to the inappropriate context)

Left: A modern kitchen.
Right: a blue armchair.

The blue armchair is not visible in the left image. It seems it is placed in a different area, likely in a studio or showroom. Here are the top 3 most likely places to search for the blue armchair:

1. The adjacent room to the kitchen, where it is currently placed (80% chance).
2. The dining or living room area near where armchairs are typically placed (15% chance).
3. A warehouse or storage area, where items might be kept temporarily (5% chance).

Search area coordinates for the armchair: (0, 35), (25, 80), (75, 85), (100, 50)
